What we'll do is the following: we'll leave the first graph without any modification, we'll shift second graph's range to [1000, 2000], because we had 1000 nodes in the graph that came before, and we'll shift the third graph's range into [2000, 3000], again because we had 2000 nodes that came before this graph. So the final edge index will have nodes in the [0, 3000] range and we treat that as a single graph with multiple connected components. ü§ì\n",
